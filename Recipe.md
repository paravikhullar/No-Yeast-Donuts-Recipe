#PART 1:
Prepare the No Yeast â€“ Eggless Dough:

1.In a large bowl, add all the ingredients and whisk to form a rough dough.
2.Sprinkle some flour on a clean surface and place the dough
3.Knead for 2 minutes to remove any cracks.


If you have time, cover the dough with wet cloth n keep for 20 minutes as this helps the dough rise or soften a little.

#PART 2:
Shape the Donuts (using everyday household items):

1.You can use 2 container lids which have sharp edges to cut through the dough:
2.Using a cookie cutter/glass/cover, make circles like donut shapes.
3.Using a smaller cover/cookie cutter, cut in between the circle to form a donut shape.
4.Remove the excess dough (you can roll the excess dough to form more donuts).

#PART 3:
Frying the Eggless Donut:

1.Heat oil in a deep pan/wok.
2.Now gently lift the donut-shaped dough and add in hot oil (2-3 max in a pot).
3.Fry them both sides on low heat until golden brown.
4.Transfer the cooked donut to a paper towel (to soak any excess oil)
5.Fry all the donuts and place on paper towel.

Transfer the hot donut to a plate and sprinkle powdered sugar or coat with favorite icing.

Serve fresh and enjoy:)
